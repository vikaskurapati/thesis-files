Cube size = 20, EndTime = 40.0, ITMStartTime=20.0, ITMTime=0.1, ScalingFactor=10, filename case10 -> energy still increases but lesser. May be we need a very big box for this to work.

Normal cube size = 2, Planar wave, ITM Time = 0.01, scaling factor = 10, filename case1 -> nothing happens as expected

case10 is case9's ITM version

material: 1,1,2, case 11
case12 is case10's ITM version -> unstable. Need more looking

29Mai
material: 1,1,2 case1
material: 16, 1.5, 1 case2
case3: case2's ITM, time=0.001, factor=10 -> works as usual. No extra reflections reflecting an extra s-wave
time=0.01 case 4 -> energy increases similar to the above one. -> I think it is because it is a linear sum, now with the final state just before ITM being the initial condition just after ITM, makes it that the only waves just after ITM are p-waves too. So, may be why there are no extra s-waves.
ampField = 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 ! Amplification of the different wave modes, 4,1,1, case 5
case6 -> ITM of case 5 and refocusing can be seen with just an swave too

30Mai
case1 -> Impedance does not change but the scaling is done only once. no decrease manager
WP_LOH1 -> case1 -> type 5- spherical wave -> only p-wave
case2 -> case1's ITM -> something weird. It immediately came back to the center and something happened. Need to look more into this

case5 -> different way with density like case1. -> it works exactly the same as the lame parameters. Still don't know why the energy is increasing
case6 -> factor 1 to check energy
case7 -> with the initializecelllocalmatrices commented out -> energy is shown as expected. No reflection, as expected

case1 -> ITM applied two times with factor 0.9

16Jun
Planar wave
case1 -> constant wave speed but varying impedance case test1 -> energy blows up -> seems there is a reflection
case2 -> lesser ITM Time, 0.01. visible reflection clearly

21Jun
ITM -> reflecting acoustic wave with proper refocusing

22Jun
ITM -> reflecting acoustic wave with the exact parameters given on github with mu=0. The waves are too fast  to see clear refocusing
ITM_2 -> lesser time of simulation and lesser ITMTime=0.01 to ensure energy does not blow too much -> works and refocusing can be seen. 
ITM_Elastic -> elastic material
ITM_Elastic_2 -> elastic material for less time = 5.0 and ITM at t=2.5
ITM_Elastic_3 -> elastic material with moment tensor with xy, yx and others zero as in the original source
